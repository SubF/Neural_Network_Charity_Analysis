# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

### Overview of Analysis

In this analysis we are analyzing a dataset of companies Alphabet Soup has invested in to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

### Results 

Use bullet list and images

Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? The IS_SUCCESSFUL column is a target because it determines if the company was successful after the Alphabet Soup investment.
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

### Summary

Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
